This kata is meant to practice paragraph and sentence momements. While you could
generally use j/k and similar, it is not the reason this kata exists. I am without
words. The half.

To practice paragraph movement, you generally want to have at least two paragrahps.
That is at least what I think. Words do count. So that's it.

Maybe a third paragraph will make things easier. Delete this sentence. Do not
delete this sentence.
